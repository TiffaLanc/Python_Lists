# Task 1 Extract the temperatures for the second week (7 days) of the month (index 7 to index 14). Expected Outcome: 83, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90.

temperatures = [72, 75, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106]

week_2_temps = temperatures[7:14]
print(week_2_temps)

# Task 2: Extract all the temperatures above 100. HINT: add the temperatures over 100 to a new list, or use list slicing to get the temperatures.

high_temps = temperatures[24:30]
